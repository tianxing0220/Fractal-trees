# Fractal-trees
Drawing of H-Tree and Fractal Tree using recursion. The template was based on a homework assignment at http://faculty.washington.edu/joelross/courses/archive/s14/cs261/hwk/6/

The tester only displays the drawing of a H-Tree using recursion, and the drawing of a fractal tree can be achieved by uncommenting the line in the Tester.java file.
